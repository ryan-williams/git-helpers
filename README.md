# git-helpers
Bash helpers for augmenting and prettifying existing git functionality.

These were written alongside other bash and python helpers that I may not have ported; let me know if you see anything missing or broken.

### Setup
* `source .git-rc` from your `.bashrc`. This will give you lots of helpful aliases!
    * You might want to make sure it's not clobbering ones you already have/use.
    * It will also put several relevant directories from this repo on your `$PATH`
* `pip install -r requirements.txt`; currently just makes sure you have `dateutil` available, which some scripts here need. These dependencies are ones that should be available globally for `git-helpers` scripts to import, as opposed to e.g. living in a virtualenv.

### "git branches" (`git b`) ###

I have this aliased to `gb` and it is one of my most commonly typed commands. It is basically a prettier and more useful version of `git branch -vv`.

Before:

![git branch -vv](http://f.cl.ly/items/3G3E123m293R2w3q0b36/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-08%20at%2010.29.21%20AM.png)

After:

Things to note:
* It sorts branches in reverse-chron order of last modification, instead of alphabetically
* It has nice colors for each field
* It has quick, at-a-glance "# commits ahead" and "# commits behind"
* It shows abbreviated "time since last commit"


#### Related: "git remote-branches" (`git br`) ####

A cousin of `git b` is `git br`, which basically does the same thing for remote branches / `git remote -v`:

Before:

![git branch -r -vv](http://f.cl.ly/items/0T2W0t3g0n2S3N240l33/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-08%20at%2010.40.02%20AM.png)

### Push Repository State to Remote: `git copy-diffs` (`git cd`) ###

I have this aliased to `gcd` and for some workflows use it very frequently.

`git-cd` pushes the state of your local repository to a "mirror" remote, preserving:
* existing branches / `HEAD` pointer, upstreams
* staged changes
* unstaged changes
* untracked (but not `.gitignore`d) files

I've been shocked to not find support for this in `git` itself, or in any other tools people have written that solve versions of this problem. Common approaches (none of which do exactly what I want, or have undesired side-effects) are:
* commit all uncommitted changes, then push to remote.
    * optionally repeatedly amend the top commit and `push -f` that.
    * I want to preserve what is committed vs. staged vs. unstaged.
* `rsync` the entire directory
    * It's important to not push `.gitignore`d files, as this will frequently contain compilation outputs and the like.
    * One approach would be to pipe e.g. the output of `git ls-files` to `rsync` in a way that `rsync` can digest.
        * This leaves out all the other state that `git` tracks; what branch you're on, what commits all branches are on, etc. I want these things copied too. 

I've implemented it here in 3 steps:
1. `rsync` the entire `.git` directory
    * this gets you all branches, index state, commits, upstream info, etc.
1. `git reset --hard HEAD`
    * the first time you do step 1, you only have a `.git` directory and none of the files that `git` thinks should be there based on the contents of `.git`; this puts everything there, but blows away the uncommitted staged changes that were stored in `.git/index`.
1. `rsync` any unstaged, staged, and untracked (but not `.gitignore`d) files, as well as `.git/index`
    * at this point all files in the "mirror" repository are equal to their counterparts in the source repo, and all `.git` state is equal as well.

#### Usage

Simply create a remote using the `add-mirror-remote` command:

    $ git add-mirror-remote my-dev-box ryan@dev-box:path/to/repo

Then you can say:

    $ git copy-diffs dev-box
    $ gcd dev-box  # for short

And all of your state will be pushed to your remote, **clobbering whatever was there previously**.

As a shortcut, you can set environment variable `$MIRROR_REMOTES` to a comma-seperated list of remote names for `git copy-diffs` to look for by default:

    $ export MIRROR_REMOTES=dev-box1,dev-box2
    $ git copy-diffs  # will push to the first remote named dev-box1 or dev-box2 found in your "remotes" list

### "g" wrapper for `git`

Self-explanatory! Who has time for that extra "it" all the time?

### "rb": interactive rebase

Usage:

    $ rb 10  # interactive rebase over the last 10 commits

Short for `git rebase -i HEAD~<n>..HEAD`, or interactive rebase over the last `n` commits.

### git safe-push-force (`git spf`)

Typing `git push -f` is terrifying (rightly so)! Even when you *know* you're just force-pushing a feature branch that is ok to clobber, you are mere characters away from disaster.

`git safe-push` (a.k.a. `g spf`) will:
* try a non-force push
* if that fails, it will:
    * dry-run a force-push so that you can see what you're about to do,
    * tell you how many commits [what you're about to push] and [what you're about to overwrite] are away from one another,
    * ask whether you want to proceed,
    * if "Y" (default), then it will execute the `push -f` you've requested.

Sample output:
```
    # Inspect local branches; I have rearranged the order of the top two commits on `master`, and want to force-push that.
    $ gb
    * master 62a4888 origin/master +2 -2 18s 2014-09-08 15:03:57 some maven compile helpers
      test   4915c28 origin/master    -5  5d 2014-09-03 20:06:25 add `git-local-branches` helper

    # safe-push to the rescue!
    $ g spf master
    Safe-pushing master to origin/master (origin master)
    Non-fast-forward push? Dry-running -f: git push -f -n 'origin' 'master'
    To git@github.com:ryan-williams/bootstrap.git
     + 62f6ac4...62a4888 master -> master (forced update)

    	Merge base: 8479c0e
    	master: +2 commits
    	origin/master: +2 commits

    Continue? [Y/n]:
    git push -f 'origin' 'master'
    Counting objects: 10, done.
    Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
    Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
    Writing objects: 100% (4/4), 521 bytes | 0 bytes/s, done.
    Total 4 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
    To git@github.com:ryan-williams/bootstrap.git
     + 62f6ac4...62a4888 master -> master (forced update)
```

It also has some handy refspec parsing, so all of the following are equivalent:
    $ g spf feature-branch ryan-feature-branch
    $ g spf origin feature-branch ryan-feature-branch
    $ g spf origin feature-branch:ryan-feature-branch
    $ g spf feature-branch:ryan-feature-branch

(if there is name ambiguity between a remote and a local branch, it will error out).

### "g lg" (pretty `git log -n`)

I have this aliased to `gln`.

Before:

![git log -n 4](http://f.cl.ly/items/1l3e020Q0r2c3u33253X/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-08%20at%2011.15.40%20AM.png)

After:

![gln 4](http://f.cl.ly/items/0v3X241T1i2O2f070D0h/Screen%20Shot%202014-09-08%20at%2011.15.24%20AM.png)

### Testing
`./run-tests` will run the bash and python tests in this repository, and is what Travis runs.

The python tests require some configuration to run locally:

```bash
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip -r requirements.dev.txt
nosetests
```

This is not necessary if you just want to use the scripts!
