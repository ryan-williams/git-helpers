There are over 900 possible 2-character Bash commands (`[a-z][a-z\d]`) and 30k+ 3-characters; a goal of this repo is to help me always be within a couple keystrokes of most common Git commands.

## Setup <a id="setup"></a>
Source [`.git-rc`](./.git-rc) in your `.bashrc`:
```bash
echo ". $PWD/.git-rc" >> ~/.bashrc  # Configure new shells to load `git-helpers`
. .bash-rc                          # "source" .bashrc, for immediate effect in existing shells
```
This will load all aliases, and add relevant directories to `$PATH`. `pip install -r requirements.txt` also ensures `python-dateutil` is installed available, which some scripts here require.

## Commands <a id="commands"></a>
More details about aliases/commands I use frequently:

### Inspect commit graph <a id="graphs"></a>
`ggr` (`git-graph`) and `gg` (`git-graph-all`) are my preferred ways to visualize Git branches and history.

Example output from this repo:

![](img/gg-git-helpers.png)

The first line shows that local branch `main` is checked out (`HEAD -> main`), and up to date with remote branches `gh/main` and `gl/main` (GitHub and GitLab, resp., but that's just a convention I use).

[runsascoded/.rc] shows several parallel branch lineages I maintain:

![](img/gg-rc.png)

I develop on `gh-all`, and cherry-pick commits over to `gh-server`, `gl-all`, and `gl-server`.

[git/git] shows wide merge lineages

### Summarize local/remote branches <a id="branches"></a>

`gb` (`git branches`) is an improved version of `git branch -vv`:
- Branches output in reverse-chron order of last modification (instead of alphabetically)
- Nice colors for each field
- Concise "commits ahead/behind" counts
- Abbreviated "time since last commit"

[TileDB-SOMA] example:

![gb](img/gb-tdbs.png)

`gbr` (`git-remote-branches`) is similar, but summarizes remotes' branches.

### Inspect commits being rebased/cherry-picked <a id="gshrh"></a>

- `grbh` (`git-rebase-head`) and `gch` (`git-cherry-pick-head`) print the SHA of the commit currently being rebased or cherry-picked.
- `gshrh` (`git-show-rebase-head`) and `gshch` (`git-show-cherry-pick-head`) pass that to `git show`.

### Rebase <a id="rebase"></a>
- `rb <N>`: interactive rebase over the last `N` commits.
- `groc` (`git-reorder-commits`): reorder ancestor commits, by index.
  - e.g. `groc 0 1` swaps the last two commits, effectively a `rebase HEAD~2` that "picks" `HEAD~0` then `HEAD~1`.
- `grbcd` (`git-rebase-preserve-commit-dates`): rebase, but inject `-x git rcd` (`reset-committer-date-rebase-head`) after each commit, so that the committer time is preserved.
- `grd` (`git-rebase-diff`): compute most recent pre-rebase SHA (`ghblr` / `git-head-before-last-rebase`), diff that vs. current worktree.
  - Useful to ensure a rebase didn't change the final work-tree, e.g. when combining or rearranging commits.
- `gtw` (`git-throw`): squash uncommitted changes onto an arbitrary previous commit.
  - `gtwp` (`git throw HEAD^`): squash staged changes onto the previous commit.

### Diff <a id="diff"></a>
- `gdg` (`git-diff-gif.py`): create a GIF of an image at two commits, open in browser
- `gdj` (`git-diff-json.py`): diff two JSON files, after pretty-printing
- `gdc` (`git diff --cached`): show staged changes only
- `gds` (`git diff --stat`): show file/line add/remove stats

### Update commit parents <a id="parents"></a>
Create a commit with a given tree and parents:
- `gcmp` (`git-commit-multiple-parents`): takes an optional commit message (`-m`) and commit (`-b`) whose tree to use
- `gsp` (`git-set-parents`) uses the current `HEAD`s message and tree

### Author/Committer/User metadata
- `gsau` (`git-set-author`): update `HEAD` author, either from Git configs, an existing commit, or literal name/email arguments.
- `gsad` (`git-set-author-date`): update `HEAD` author date; match another commit's, or `HEAD`'s committer date.
- `gscd` (`git-set-committer-date`): update `HEAD` committer date; match another commit's, or `HEAD`'s author date.
- `gsid` (`git-set-id`), `ggsid` (`git-set-id -g`): set `user.{name,email}` configs.

### Push repo state to remote <a id="copy-diffs"></a>

`gcd` (`git copy-diffs`) pushes the state of your local repository to a "mirror" remote, preserving:
* existing branches / `HEAD` pointer, upstreams
* staged changes
* unstaged changes
* untracked (but not `.gitignore`d) files

I've been shocked to not find support for this in `git` itself, or in any other tools people have written that solve versions of this problem. Common approaches (none of which do exactly what I want, or have undesired side-effects) are:
* commit all uncommitted changes, then push to remote.
    * optionally repeatedly amend the top commit and `push -f` that.
    * I want to preserve what is committed vs. staged vs. unstaged.
* `rsync` the entire directory
    * It's important to not push `.gitignore`d files, as this will frequently contain compilation outputs and the like.
    * One approach would be to pipe e.g. the output of `git ls-files` to `rsync` in a way that `rsync` can digest.
        * This leaves out all the other state that `git` tracks; what branch you're on, what commits all branches are on, etc. I want these things copied too.

I've implemented it here in 3 steps:
1. `rsync` the entire `.git` directory
    * this gets you all branches, index state, commits, upstream info, etc.
1. `git reset --hard HEAD`
    * the first time you do step 1, you only have a `.git` directory and none of the files that `git` thinks should be there based on the contents of `.git`; this puts everything there, but blows away the uncommitted staged changes that were stored in `.git/index`.
1. `rsync` any unstaged, staged, and untracked (but not `.gitignore`d) files, as well as `.git/index`
    * at this point all files in the "mirror" repository are equal to their counterparts in the source repo, and all `.git` state is equal as well.

#### Usage

Simply create a remote using the `add-mirror-remote` command:

    $ git add-mirror-remote my-dev-box ryan@dev-box:path/to/repo

Then you can run:

    $ git copy-diffs dev-box
    $ gcd dev-box  # for short

And all local state will be pushed to the remote, **clobbering whatever was there previously**.

As a shortcut, you can set environment variable `$MIRROR_REMOTES` to a comma-seperated list of remote names for `git copy-diffs` to look for by default:

    $ export MIRROR_REMOTES=dev-box1,dev-box2
    $ git copy-diffs  # will push to the first remote named dev-box1 or dev-box2 found in your "remotes" list
